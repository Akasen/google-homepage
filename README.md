NOTE: This attempt setups the basic logo, search bar, buttons, and footer links.
      The header links were ignored largely because I wanted to recreate what
      Google was doing with their HTML and CSS as faithfully as possible, but
      had trouble doing so. I did not want to concede to using unordered lists
      to get the results.

      Search bar does not change drop shadow when hovered over.
